# jupyter_migration_demo
This repo demos the steps to migrate jupyter notebooks to python packages

Special thanks to [Baligh Mnassri, Ph.D.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baligh-mnassri/?locale=en_US) Without his concent I can't use his notebook to demo the steps.

# Steps I took to migrate jupyter notebooks
1. Make data lineage diagram
2. Collect input data, intermediate data, and final results
   - Use notebook console to save data --> Not touching notebook cells
   - Data file naming:
     - Inputs: put raw in the filename
     - Intermediate data: put a number in the filename
     - Results (the last dataframe): put “result” in the filename
3. Set up unit tests for the code from cells  verify if the copied code is correct
   - Set up fixtures
   - Create unit tests following cell order --> split concerns
   - Define meaningful unit test name
4. Object-level refactoring
   - Copy all unit tests and remove “test” from the function names
   - Create an object to run the functions used in unit tests
5. Set up tests for the object
6. (optional) Function-level refactoring 
   - Copy the unit tests in Step 3 
   - Start refactoring
